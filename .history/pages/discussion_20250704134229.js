      fullContent: `New to campus and looking for good food recommendations. Preferably budget-friendly options that are walking distance from the main campus. Any hidden gems you'd recommend?

## What I'm looking for:
- **Budget**: Under $15 per meal
- **Distance**: Within 10-minute walk from main campus
- **Cuisine**: Open to anything, but love Asian and Mediterranean food
- **Atmosphere**: Good for studying or hanging out with friends

## Dietary preferences:
- Vegetarian-friendly options preferred
- Not too spicy (mild to medium is fine)
- Good portion sizes

## Current favorites:
1. **Campus Café** - Great coffee and sandwiches, but gets crowded
2. **Pizza Corner** - Decent pizza, but limited vegetarian options

## Questions:
- Any places that offer student discounts?
- Best spots for late-night food (after 10 PM)?
- Places that deliver to dorms?
- Good breakfast spots before 8 AM classes?

I've been eating at the dining hall mostly, but want to explore more options. Also interested in grocery stores nearby for cooking in the dorm kitchen.

Thanks in advance for any recommendations! Happy to share my findings once I try new places.`,
